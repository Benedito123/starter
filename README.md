# Welcome to Devito OGHPC Devito-GPU hackathon


That's enough of the pleasantries. Let us get started. 
First off, you need to click on this link:
https://labs.azure.com/register/jltt9mv2

You will be redirected to your Azure Labs VM.
There you can set your password for logging in to your VM.
You have to wait for a minute or so.
When your password is updated, click on the screen emoji at your VM and select
`Connect via SSH`. Copy the ssh command to your terminal
and start hacking!
